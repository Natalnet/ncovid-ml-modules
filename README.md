# ncovid-ml-modules
modules for the whole ML workflow (so far)

- Many things still to be added
- methods name are a little confusing so far
- This code runs on Python 3.7. The package list is here. 
- A lot of work had to be done to run this code due to some obscure problems (such as restarting python session, many many problems with numpy version, etc).
