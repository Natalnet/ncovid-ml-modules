# NCovid ML Modules
NCovid ML Modules is a standalone library for machine learning applications, compatible with receiving requests as web-point.

> The NCovid-ml-modules design goal is improving formatting and facilitating is
> to make ml pipelines readable and optimized. The idea is that a time-series dataframe 
> or a table data should be preprocessed and submitted to the use of 
> many applications to data regression problems.

## Tech
NCovid ML Modules uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python 3][Python] - a powerful general-purpose programming language
- [Pandas][Pandas] - fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool
- [NumPy][NumPy] - comprehensive mathematical functions
- [Keras][Keras] - an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks
- [Matplotlib][Matplotlib] - plotting library

And of course NCovid ML Modules itself is open source with a [public repository][ncovid] on GitHub.

This code runs on Python 3.7

## Installation

### Prerequisites

We have tested the library in Ubuntu 20.04, 19.04, 18.04, and 16.04, but it should be easy to compile on other platforms.
### Libraries


Please make sure that it has installed all the required dependencies. 
A list of items to be installed using pip install can be running as following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Folder structure
>Project Folder Structure and Files

* [src](src) : main Python package with source of the model.
* [dbs](src/dbs/) : used as a local path to store and load data and models.
* [docs](src/docs/) : contains documentation of the project.
* [jupyter-notebook](src/jupyter-notebook/) : contains jupyter notebooks evaluation and modeling experimentation.
