# ncovid-ml-modules
modules for the whole ML workflow (so far)

- Many things still to be added
- methods name are a little confusing so far
- This code runs on Python 3.7. The package list is [here](package-list). You can use [this yaml](environment.yml) to create a simular anaconda enviroment using 
```console
foo@bar:~$ conda env create --file environment.yml
```
- A lot of work had to be done to run this code due to some obscure problems (such as restarting python session, many many problems with numpy version, etc). So i recomend creating a conda enviroment with the instructions above.
